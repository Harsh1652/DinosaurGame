A simple, offline-style Dinosaur Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project mimics the classic game found in Google Chrome when there's no internet connection.

- Obstacle Generation: Randomly generates cacti and pterodactyls as obstacles.
- Score Tracking: Keeps track of the player's score during the game.
- Game Over: Displays a game over message when the player collides with an obstacle.
- Responsive Design: Scales well across different screen sizes.

# Technologies Used

- HTML: Structure of the game and elements.
- CSS: Styling and animations of game objects.
- JavaScript: Game logic, obstacle movement, player control, and score system.
